1. Project Title : Analisis of Fraud


This is an assignment we did for our "Machine Learning" course in our Master of Data Science in CUNEF. We are analysing a dataset with banking transactions and tryinig to make a better guess in predicting fraudulent transactions.

2. Problem Description:

0.1% of the transactions in this data set, end up being in being fraud. This is very rare. However when occurs, it can create a big business damage to the banks, and to their customers. Attackers everyday try newer and much smarter ways to steal 3rd parties money from their account. Therefore, it is important to detect fraudulent transactions. At the same time, it is important to detect real fraudulent transactions but not to accuse real transactions. If we falsely accuse some customers with fraud, this can also end up with business losses. As a reuslt, apart from we did this for our assignmnet, this is an important business problem that any data scientist, would like to research. We are welcoming any comments or contributions on this project.

In general in this project we have learned to deploy a project from scratch. We have done some data cleaning (not so much compared to some other datasets), we have used pipelines in our coding, we had opportunity to try differnet supervised algorithms of machine learning and for the first time we tried library SHAP for explicability of the models.


3. How to Install and Run the Project?

We have used python version 3.9.6
Environment details will befound and requirements file of this project.


4. How to use the Project?

This is a data analisis project. You can consult to our code for your own projects on different other topics. In addition, if you would like to contribute to this particular project, you can make a pull request to improve our analisis. We are beginners, we are open to all suggestions. We also would like to help all beginners like us. Please do not hesitate to contact if you want to ask anything.
